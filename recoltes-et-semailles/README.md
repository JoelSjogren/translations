# Translation of _Recoltes et Semailles_
## _Réflections et témoignage sur un passé de mathématicien_
### Written by Alexander Grothendieck, in the early 1980s.

Roy Lisker translated most of [the promenade](https://uberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RS-grothendeick1.pdf). So it makes sense to continue where he left off, namely with the section called "Epilogue: les Cercles invisibles". Links to the various translated sections will be added in the [table of contents](table-of-contents.md). I think I will translate the titles and contents of a section at the same time.

Contributions are welcome. Maybe I misunderstand some sentence here and there, or you would like it to sound more natural in English. But above all, the book is too long for a slow person like myself to translate on my own.

I have inserted [...] or <sup>[superscripts]</sup> to indicate places where the translation is incomplete or likely inaccurate. (Superscripts are also used very occasionally when there is additional clarifying information.) If you want to contribute, you can start here!

The reference version in French can be found [here](http://acm.math.spbu.ru/RS/.). I intend to hardcode the same footnote numbering, but the original page numbers will be omitted. I printed a copy of it online.

Imagine having a translated copy!

Update: A version with fewer typographical errors and fewer omissions of footnotes can be found [here](https://www.quarante-deux.org/archives/klein/prefaces/Romans_1965-1969/Recoltes_et_semailles.pdf).
