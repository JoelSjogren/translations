# Translation of _Recoltes et Semailles_
## _Réflections et témoignage sur un passé de mathématicien_
### Written by Alexander Grothendieck, in the early 1980s.

Roy Lisker translated most of [the promenade](https://uberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RS-grothendeick1.pdf). So it makes sense to continue where he left off, namely with the section called "Epilogue: les Cercles invisibles". Links to the various translated sections will be added in the [table of contents](table-of-contents.md). I think I will translate the titles and contents of a section at the same time.

Contributions are welcome. Maybe I misunderstand some sentence here and there, or you would like it to sound more natural in English. But above all, the book is too long for a slow person like myself to translate on my own.

The reference version in French can be found [here](http://acm.math.spbu.ru/RS/.). I intend to hardcode the same footnote numbering, but the original page numbers will be omitted. I printed a copy of it online.

Imagine having a translated copy!
