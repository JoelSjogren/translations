### (6) Mathematics yin and yang

#### a. The most "macho" art there is
(November 5) It's been a while that I have intended to speak about yin and yang in mathematics. The two aspects of yin and yang in a mathematical work, or in an approach to mathematics, appeared to me only in the course of the reflection over the last seeks on the yin and the yang. I was planning to probe a tiny bit in these notes this double aspect, which would be the most natural way of "getting back on topic" [fr: revenir à mes moutons], in these notes which are supposed to constitute a retrospective on "the past of a mathematician".

This which was clear to me from my first reflections on yin and yang (five years ago), was that "doing maths" is maybe the _most yang_, the most "masculine" among all known human activities to this day. As a matter of fact, any entirely intellectual activity, like notably the scientific research and, more generally, any activity commonly qualified as "research", is an activity with very strong predominance of yang. I was going to write: "marked by a yang imbalance", and this is indeed the case when this activity comes to absorb the near-totality of the energy of a person. This yang predominance (or imbalance) becomes visible through the calling forth of many yin-yang couples, for which it is clear that it is the term yang especially, not to say exclusively, which is "present" in intellectual work. I limit myself to mentioning a few, that all make part of the same "group" (or of the same "gateway to the world"), that I call the group of "the vague &mdash; the precise". (Note: in this last couple and those which follow, it is the yin term which comes first.)

I just went through my repertoire of yin-yang, and [...] other pairs that make felt the superyang character of this purely intellectual activity. [...] the couple of _body&ndash;spirit_.

Seeing this, it seems to me like among the diverse types of intellectual activity, it is mathematical work which represents the "ultimate extreme-yang". This is no doubt due to [...] its character of extreme abstraction, the fact that it is, to a very large extent, independent of any "support" by a sensory experience and a rational obsevation of the external world, of that where I hear we live and where our bodies move. This extreme character of abstraction distinguishes mathematics from every other science, and mathematical work from every other intellectual work, by being a science or a work "of pure reason". As opposed to experimental sciences and sciences of observation it is also the only science whose results are established by _proofs_ in the most rigorous sense of the word, proceeding by a rigorously codified and in principle infallible _method_, called _"logic"_, for achieving certainties which leave no place for any doubts or reservations, or the possibility of exceptions that would have eluded all cases up until the present. All these extreme-yang features come together in the mathematical work, and in this work only.

Certainly these features [...]

#### b. The beautiful stranger
(November 6) Looking back just now at the notes of yesterday, I was able to assure myself that I had paid attention not to relapse into a certain confusion between the mathematical _work_, an activity with very strong and dominant yang, and "_the_ mathematics" [fr: **la** mathématique]. It is certainly not a coincidence if in French like in German, the word which designates it is of feminine gender, just like _"science"_ [fr: **la** science], which is more general, or the still wider term _"knowledge"_ [fr: **la** connaissance]<sup>600</sup>(&ast;), or also _"substance"_ [fr: **la** substance]. By the mathematician in the proper sense of the word, I mean one who "makes mathematics" (like he "makes love"). There is in fact no ambiguity to the distribution of roles in his relation to mathematics, to the unknown substance thus that he meets, that [...]

I realized for the first time the profound identity between the impulse which drew me toward "the woman", and that which draws me toward "the mathematics", a few months before the encountering the verses of the Tao Te Ching which would
