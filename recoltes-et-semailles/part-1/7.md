### 7. The legacy of Galois
It would seem that among all the natural sciences, it isn't in mathematics that that which I have called "the dream", or "the [...] dream", is hit like something apparently absolutely disallowed, more than two times per millennium. In the other sciences, including the sciences reputed as "exact" such as physics, the dream is at least tolerated, seen encouragingly (according to the epoches), under names it is very "sortable" as: "speculations", "hypotheses" (such as the famous "atomic hypothesis", issued by a dream, if we neglect a speculation by Democritus), "theories"... The passage from a status of dream-whose-name-we-dare-not-say to that of "scientific truth" is done by insensible degrees, by a consensus that grows progressively. In mathematics on the other hand, it's almost always (nowadays at least) about a sudden transformation, by virtue of the waving of a magic wand of a _demonstration_ (<sup>4</sup>).

(<sup>4</sup>) Besides, even nowadays we encounter "demonstrations" of uncertain status. It has been this way during the years of the demonstration of the theorem by Grauert on finitude which bears his name, that no one (and the ones who tried were not lacking!)<sup>[misinterpreted?]</sup> can read. This perplexity has been resolved by other more transparent demonstrations, and which certainly went further, that took over the initial demonstration. A similar situation, more extreme, is the "solution" to the problem called "4 colors", whose computational part was settled by computer (and by millions of dollars). There it's thus about a "demonstration" which is no longer founded in the intimate conviction coming from comprehension &mdash; about a mathematical situation, but [...]
