### 19. Death is my cradle (or three kids for a dying man)
Until the appearance of the topos-theoretic point of view, toward the end of the 20th century, the evolution of the notion of space seems to me like an essentially "continuous" development. It seems to proceed without bumps or jumps, from the Euclidean theorization of the space which surrounds us, and the geometry handed down to us by the Greeks, hanging onto the study of certain "figures" (lines, planes, circles, triangles etc) that live in this space. Granted, profound changes have taken place in the manner in which the mathematician or the "natural philosopher" conceives of "space"<sup>66</sup>(*). But all these changes seem to me to have the nature of an essential "continuity" &mdash; they never placed the mathematician, attached (like everybody) to familiar mental images, in front of a sudden change of _scenery_. These were like the changes, profound maybe but progressive, which took place over the years in a creature we would have known already as children, and whose evolution we would have followed since its first steps until its adulthood and its full maturity. Changes imperceptible over some long periods of dead calm, perhaps tumultous during others. But even during the most intense periods of growth and ripening, and hence even as we might have lost sight of it for months, even years, at no moment could there have been the slighest doubt, the slightest hesitation: it is him again, a well-known and familiar being, who we found, but with changed features.

<sup>66</sup>(*) My initial intention, when writing the Epilogue, was to include a very brief sketch of some of these "profound changes", and to make apparent this "essential continuity" as I see it. I gave up, in order not to lengthen beyond mesure this Promenade, which is already much longer than planned. I'm thinking of coming back to this in the Historical Comments planned for volume 4 of the "Reflections", with the intention this time of a mathematical reader (this changes the task of exposition completely).
