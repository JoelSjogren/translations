### 7. Respect and fortitude
But I digress again, in anticipation of that which the reflection taught me. I had been using a double aim, clearly present in me since even before the beginning of this: the aim of a "declaration of intentions", and (intimately linked to this, as it will appear) that of expressing myself on the subject of the nature of creative work. There was however also a third aim, less clearly present surely at a conscious level, but answering to a more profound and more essential need. It was generated by the sometimes disconcerting "interpellations", reaching me in my life as a mathematician through the voice of those who were my students or my friends (or at least, a good number of them). At an epidermal level, this need reflected a desire to "get it off my chest" [fr: vider mon sac], to say some "uncomfortable truths". But more profoundly, surely, there was a need to finally _get acquainted_ with a certain past, that I have so far chosen to avoid. It is from this need, above all, that Harvests and Sowings originates. This long reflection was my "response", day-by-day, to this drive toward understanding in me, and to the constantly renewed interpellation which came to me from the external world, from the "mathematical world" that I quit without meaning to return. Except for the very first pages of "Fatuité et Renouvellement", those which form the two first chapters ("Travail et découverte" and "The dream and the Dreamer"), and from the chapter which follows "Naissance de la crainte", with a "testimony" which was by no means part of the plan, it is this need to make acquaintance with my past and to take it on in full, which (I think) has been the principal force at work in the writing of Harvests and Sowings.
