### 7. Respect and fortitude
But I digress again, in anticipation of that which the reflection taught me. I had been using a double aim, clearly present in me since even before the beginning of this: the aim of a "declaration of intentions", and (intimately linked to this, as it will appear) that of expressing myself on the subject of the nature of creative work. There was however also a third aim, less clearly present surely at a conscious level, but answering to a more profound and more essential need. It was generated by the sometimes disconcerting "interpellations", reaching me in my life as a mathematician through the voice of those who were my students or my friends (or at least, a good number of them). At an epidermal level, this need reflected a desire to "get it off my chest" [fr: vider mon sac], to say some "uncomfortable truths". But more profoundly, surely, there was a need to finally _get acquainted_ with a certain past, that I have so far chosen to avoid. It is from this need, above all, that Harvests and Sowings originates. This long reflection was my "response", day-by-day, to this drive toward understanding in me, and to the constantly renewed interpellation which came to me from the external world, from the "mathematical world" that I quit without meaning to return. Except for the very first pages of "Fatuité et Renouvellement", those which form the two first chapters ("Travail et découverte" and "The dream and the Dreamer"), and from the chapter which follows "[Naissance de la crainte](../table-of-contents.md#part-1-3)", with a "testimony" which was by no means part of the plan, it is this need to make acquaintance with my past and to take it on in full, which (I think) has been the principal force at work in the writing of Harvests and Sowings.

The interpellation which came to me from the world of mathematicians, and which returned to me with a new force throughout Harvests and Sowings (and especially, during the "investigation" [fr: enquête] pursued in parts [II](../table-of-contents.md#part-2), and [IV](../table-of-contents.md#part-4)), immediately took the mask of complacency [fr: suffisance], when not that of disdain ("delicately proportioned"), of derision or contempt, whether it be toward me (sometimes) or (especially) toward those who dared to be inspired by me (without suspecting, certainly, what was waiting for them) and who were "classified" as having links to me, by some tacit and implacable decree. And again I see here the "evident" and "profound" connection appearing, between _respect_ (or the absence of respect) for another person; this for the act of creation and for certain of its most delicate and essential fruits; and finally the respect for the most obvious rules of scientific ethics: those which are rooted in an elementary respect for oneself and others and which I would be tempted to call the _"rules of decency"_ in the exercise of our art. There are many aspects, surely, of an elementary and essential _"respect for oneself"_. If trying, in a single terse formula, to take stock of that which Harvests and Sowings has taught me on the subject of a certain world which was mine, a world with which I identified for more than twenty years of my life, I would say: it is a world which has _lost respect_<sup>99</sup>(&ast;).

This was already strongly felt, if not formulated, since the years before. It was only confirmed and made more precise, in a manner always unexpected and sometimes stupefying, throughout Harvests and Sowings. It was clearly apparent already from the moment when a reflection of "philosophical" and general nature suddenly became a personal testimony (in the section "L'étranger bienvenu" opening the chapter "Naissance de la crainte" already cited).
