### 2. Birth of Récoltes et Semailles (retrospective in a flash)
In this pre-letter, I would now like to tell you in a few pages (if possible) about what the questions are in Récoltes et Semailles &mdash; to tell you in a more detailed manner that which the subtitle alone could not: "Reflections and testimony of a mathematician's past" (my past, as you'll have guessed...) There are many things in Récoltes et Semailles, and some people will without doubt see different things in it: a _voyage_ to the discoveries of a past; a _meditation_ on existence; a _tableau de mœurs_ of an environment and of an epoch (or a painting of insidious and impeccable slips from one epoch to another...); a _survey_ (almost policing at times, and at others verging on a swashbuckler novel in the sidestreets of the mathematical metropolis...); a vast _mathematical rambling_ (which will shake off more than one...); a practical treatise in applied psychoanalysis (or, if preferred, a book of "phychoanalysis fiction"); a panegyric of the _knowledge of self_; "My _confessions_"; an intimate _journal_; a psychology of _discovery and of creation_; a _formal accusation_ [fr: réquisitoire] (merciless, as it has to be...), even a _settling of accounts_ in "the fine world of mathematics" (and without giving away any presents...). This much is certain, at no moment was I upset when writing, while I learned and saw all colors. If your important tasks allow you the leisure to read it, it would surprise me that you were bored by reading me. [...]

Visibly, this is not only addressed to mathematicians. It is true also that at certain moments, it is addressed more to mathematicians than to others. In this pre-letter to the "letter Récoltes et Semailles", I would like to resume and bring out especially, precisely, that which may concern you more particularly as a mathematician. The most natural, for doing this, would be recount to you simply how I have come, gradually, to write one after the other these four or five "thick books" [fr: pavés] in question.

As you know, I left "the big world" of mathematics in 1970, following a history of military funding in my institution (l'IHES). After some years of ecological and anti-military activism, in the "cultural revolution" style, of which you surely had some echo here and there, I practically disappeared from circulation, lost in a university of the province God knows where. The rumor says that I passed my time guarding sheep and drilling wells. The truth is that apart from a lot of other occupations, I went bravely, like everyone, to [...]
