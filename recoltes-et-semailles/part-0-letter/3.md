### 3. The boss is dead &mdash; abandoned building sites
It is time, I feel, to give some explanations: why I quit so abruptly a world in which, apparently, I felt at ease for tweny years of my life; why I had the strange idea to come back (like a zombie...) when things had been going well without me these fifteen years; and finally why an introduction to a mathematical work of six or seven hundred pages ended up at twelve (or fourteen) hundred. And it is here also, when entering into the heart of the matter, that I will without doubt worry you (sorry!), even annoy you. For no doubt that, like me long ago, you want to see "in pink" the environment of which you are a part, where you have your place, your name and all that. I know what it is... And there, it will squeak a little...

I talk here and there in RÃ©coltes et Semailles of the episode of my departure, without stopping too much. The "departure" there appears rather like an important caesura in my life as a mathematician &mdash; it is in relation to this "point" that the events of my life as a mathematician constantly situate themselves, as "before" and "after". A shock of great force was needed to tear myself away from an environment where I was strongly rooted, and from a "trajectory" which had been heavily drawn. The shock came from the confrontation, in an environment with which I was strongly identified, with a certain form of corruption<sup>85</sup>(*), from which I had until then chosen to look away (by simply abstaining from participating). With the retreat, I realized that beyond the event, there was however a very profound force at work in me. It was an intense _need for internal renewal_. Such a renewal couldn't be accomplished and pursued in the tepid ambiance of the scientific drying oven of a high standard institution.
