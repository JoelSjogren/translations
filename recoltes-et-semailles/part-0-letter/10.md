### 10. Four waves in motion

As usual, this letter does not look at all like what I intended to put down. In particular I thought about making a small "update" in the Burial: this is what happened in broad terms, believe it or not (myself I found it difficult to believe it...), but this is nevertheless it, unmistakable even, whether you like it or not, publications black on white in periodicals or books, on such date and such page, all you have to do is look &mdash; moreover all is unscrewed by the menu in Harvests and Sowings; see "[Quatre Operations](../table-of-contents.md#part-4)" for such notes &mdash; take it or leave it! And if you prefer to abstain from reading me, others will take care of it in your stead...

Finally nothing like that happened &mdash; and although this letter is already heading toward thirty pages, when I was planning on five or six all in all. Even without having made it on purpose, they are essential things that I was lead to tell you, over the pages, even though this "bag" that I was so impatient to empty ([...]), has still not been unpacked!
