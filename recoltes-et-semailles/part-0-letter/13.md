### 13. The bottle spectrograph

It is seven well-crammed months since this Letter was written, and nearly four months since it was sent, with the "pav√©" that went with it. And each with a dedication by my own hand<sup>127</sup>(&ast;). Like a "message in a bottle", or rather, like a whole bunch of such bottles vagabonding, my message has gone to land and circulate down to the most remote corners of this mathematical microcosm which was familiar to me. And by the echoes direct and indiect which have come back to me over the course of days, weeks and months, here I am unexpectedly like in front of a vast radiography of the mathematical environment, one which would be taken by a tentacled spectrograph, of which my innocent "bottles" would be so much as travelling antennas. Suddenly (noblesse oblige!), me who does not lack something to occupy him, here I am in front of the new task of deciphering the radio and of realizing, in any way that I will be able to, anything [...] I have read. It will be the sixth (and last, I promise!) part of Harvests and Sowings. This one will therefore crown, life permitting, "the big sociological work of my later years". For the moment, some initial comments.

To accomodate my modest and very artisanal flotilla, this which seems to dominate and at a distance, it is the mi-gouailleur, mi-hargneux<sup>[translation needed]</sup> tone, to the tune of "here is Grothendieck becoming paranoid in his old age", or "here comes one who takes himself too seriously" &mdash; and the rook is played! I have not yet had a single letter in that style<sup>128</sup>(&ast;&ast;), more than two others still in that of a cosy derision and delighted with themselves<sup>129</sup>(&ast;&ast;&ast;). The majority of my mathematical recipients, among them those who were my students, have responded with silence<sup>130</sup>(&ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;) &mdash; a silence which to me says a lot.
